Question/need:
This project will aim to explore differences in conversation between political ideologies on the Twitter platform. The goal is to gather data by searching on politically-related hashtags and do topic-modelling to see the differences between what dominates those conversations and how that differs between groups, if a difference exists. The end product will likely include visualisations of the clusters of conversation/topics.

On Tools:
Tweepy for acquisition, Mongo for storage, SKLearn likely for all the used ML tools. If, in the end, the result lends itself to interaction in some capacity, I will also host on Streamlit. Lastly, might also use VADER for unsupervised sentiment analysis, if the project lends itself to that. 

An MVP will look like:
Pipeline should be finished to do the following: Data tokenised and t-NSE applied to form a two-feature space for visualisation, and possibly also do a networking algorithm as well if I can figure it out.
