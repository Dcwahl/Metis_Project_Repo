# IMDB: Gaming the Rating System
Diego Wahl

# Abstract
IMDB is easily the popular film and television related website currently on the internet. As a result, there is actually quite a bit to gain by having your film well rated and thus highly visible in the form of Top X lists by rating. This project looks to explore a number of features of the movies in the Top 1000 list by rating to see if a Linear Regressive Model can be trained to accurately predict whether a movie, based on these attributes, will be succesful in the IMDB rating system. 

# Design

# Data
The data used in this project were scraped entirely from IMDB and Box Office Mojo websites. In all, the top 1000 movies by rating from the IMDB were selected.

# Algorithms
